# 📵 BayesSpamBlocker

**BayesSpamBlocker** is a lightweight and effective spam text message classifier built using Bayes' Theorem. Designed specifically for SMS-style short texts — which often contain slang, abbreviations, and incomplete sentences — this tool filters out spam using probabilistic reasoning, making it highly suitable for real-world mobile messaging.

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional email spam filters fall short when applied to text messaging due to the differences in structure and language. **BayesSpamBlocker** leverages the power of the Naïve Bayes algorithm to accurately classify messages as spam or ham (not spam), even with noisy or limited data.

Whether you're developing a secure messaging app or simply want to experiment with NLP-based filters, this project provides a solid foundation for mobile-oriented spam detection.

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   The model uses a labeled dataset of SMS messages and performs cleaning such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering.

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   It calculates the frequency of words across spam and non-spam messages to determine word probabilities.

3. **Bayesian Inference**  
   Applies Bayes’ Theorem to compute the likelihood that a new message is spam, based on its word composition.
